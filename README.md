Don't want to click the tests each iteration for your change in code?  Yeah, annoyed me day 1 too.  My robot fixes that irritation.  It will keep editing and committing for you until the compiling completes without errors.  Over time, we will have it self improve to increase it's speed and effectiveness.  Now or then, either way it's a win! Gill.
